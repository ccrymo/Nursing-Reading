  readingTextTitle: "Shopping Preferences and Choices",
  readingText: "People around the world enjoy shopping, but what influences their choices? For many, price is a significant factor-they want to save money. Quality is also essential, as people desire products that last. Another factor is availability; people prefer accessible items without spending too much time looking.\n\nOnline shopping has changed how people shop. Now, they can easily compare prices and read product reviews before buying. In several countries, reviews are an essential part of the shopping process, giving shoppers confidence in their choices. In Japan, consumers value locally made items, believing in their quality. Meanwhile, in the U.S., people tend to enjoy a variety of international options.\n\nIn some cultures, shopping is a social event. People might go shopping with family and friends, and family members' opinions are often highly valued. For example, in Arab countries, shopping for special occasions involves buying high-quality branded items, sometimes with family input.\n\nIn 2024, a study examined shopping habits in Germany and South Korea. It found that Germans are more likely to shop online to save time, while South Koreans prefer to shop in stores where they can physically see and feel products. Social media also influences shopping, especially among young people, who often follow trends online.",
